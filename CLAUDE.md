# franken-agents

Personal Claude Code (sometimes Codex) plugin marketplace. Three plugins right now: `saucy-status`, `react-monkey`, `linear-devotee`.

> **Pour créer un nouveau plugin / skill / agent**, invoque les skills locaux :
> `/scaffold-plugin`, `/scaffold-skill`, `/scaffold-agent`. Ils embarquent
> toutes les conventions techniques (frontmatter, structure de dossiers,
> manifest, hooks, format SDD, naming rules, anti-patterns) et génèrent
> les fichiers au bon endroit. Ce CLAUDE.md ne les redocumente plus —
> les skills sont la source de vérité pour le scaffolding.

## Vibe (don't skip this)

This marketplace is unapologetically **brainrot-coded**. **Brainrot forever.** Each plugin has its own dumb personality and answers in character — that's the product, not a quirk. The plugin names, personas, and user-facing voices are load-bearing.

New plugins follow this energy:

- **Plugin name** = fun/absurd internet-meme word that sets a theme: `saucy-status` (saucy/gooning), `react-monkey` (chaotic creature), `linear-devotee` (feral devotee / carnal worship). Family-resemblance with the existing trio. Tier list of acceptable directions: brainrot internet slang (skibidi, rizz, sigma — only if it lands), animal/creature, kink-adjacent personas, mythical figures. **Avoid** corporate/technical names (`linear-helper`, `task-manager`, `ai-assistant`).
- **Persona voice** = each plugin has its own dumb personality and *speaks like it*. Voice shows up everywhere user-facing: skill outputs, hook messages, reports, error states, hand-off menus. The agent stays in character throughout the skill — not just a clever opener that fades into neutral prose. **The canonical voice of each plugin lives in `<plugin>/persona.md`** (frontmatter `name`/`tagline`/`emoji` + body prose). That file is the single source of truth, referenced by every skill of the plugin via a `## Voice` section that points to it. **This CLAUDE.md does not define voices** — it only references them. Read the persona file to know how a plugin sounds.
  - `saucy-status` → see `saucy-status/persona.md`
  - `react-monkey` → see `react-monkey/persona.md`
  - `linear-devotee` → see `linear-devotee/persona.md`
  - Future plugins → invent the persona at brainstorm time, **write it down in `<plugin>/persona.md`**, and apply it consistently across the plugin's skills. Do not redeclare the voice in this CLAUDE.md.
- **Reports follow the voice**. The structure stays plain, the surrounding 1-2 lines are brainrot. Same skill, same voice end-to-end.
- **Hard rule**: actions stay serious, voice stays brainrot. No fantasy side-effects, no joke commits, no "lol whoops" failure modes. Only the *strings* are fun.
- **Use emojis sparingly**. 🥺 / 👑 / 😔 / 🔥 land. Anything more is over-emoji and feels AI-slop.

When building a new skill, write the prompts/outputs in the plugin's voice from the start — don't bolt it on later.

### Persona Roulette (local to this repo)

When you open Claude Code in this repo, a `SessionStart` hook (`.claude/hooks/persona-roulette.mjs`, declared in `.claude/settings.json`) randomly picks one of the `<plugin>/persona.md` files and injects its body as the **default voice for the session** via `additionalContext`. It's only active inside this repo — installed plugins still behave normally everywhere else.

Rules:
- The roulette **never modifies** any skill, agent, or plugin file. It only injects a session-level default voice.
- Skills with a `## Voice` section override the roulette **inside their scope** — they read their own `<plugin>/persona.md` and apply that voice. The roulette voice is the default for *everything else* in the session (general chat, reports outside skills, error responses).
- Disable for one session: `SKILL_ISSUE_PERSONA=off claude`.
- Add a new persona to the pool: drop a `persona.md` at the root of any plugin with the standard frontmatter (`name`, `tagline`, optional `emoji`) and a body. The hook auto-discovers via `<repoRoot>/*/persona.md` glob. (The local scaffold skills' shared persona at `.claude/skills/persona.md` is **not** in the pool — it's scoped to those skills only.)
- Tests: `cd .claude/hooks/tests && bunx bun test` (the `.claude` hidden dir is skipped by bun's default scan, so either `cd` in or pass an absolute path).

---

## Stack & tooling

- **Runtime hooks/scripts**: Node.js, **ESM** (`import` / `export`). **`.mjs`** extension is mandatory for hooks and tests (zero ambiguity for Node, no `package.json` needed in the plugin, plugin is self-contained regardless of install context). `saucy-status` stays on CJS for historical reasons. Every new plugin ships ESM `.mjs`. Reference: `linear-devotee/claudecode/hooks/*.mjs`.
- **Package manager**: `bun@1.3.x` (declared in root `package.json`).
- **Tests**: `bun test` (built-in, no dep added). Tests live in `<plugin>/<runtime>/tests/`.
- **Lint/format**: `biome` (config in `biome.json`). Formatter off, linter on. Local rule: `noUnusedVariables` is on → use `catch {}` (not `catch (e)`) when the binding is unused. Biome will auto-organize imports — let it.
- **Pre-commit**: `lefthook` runs `bunx biome check .`. **Never bypass** with `--no-verify`.
- **No npm/bun deps added** in plugins. Stick to `node:fs`, `node:path`, `node:os`, `node:child_process`. If a plugin really needs a dep, raise it first.

## Pre-push verification

```bash
bunx bun test <plugin>/                    # all plugin tests pass
(cd .claude/hooks/tests && bunx bun test)  # persona-roulette tests pass
bunx biome check .                          # lint clean
node -e "JSON.parse(require('node:fs').readFileSync('.claude-plugin/marketplace.json', 'utf8'))"  # marketplace JSON valid
grep -rn "superpower\|writing-plans" <plugin>/   # no superpowers leak
```

## Anti-patterns to avoid

Global guidance — applies everywhere, not just at scaffold time:

- ❌ Pollute main context with MCP fetches / massive reads → **always dispatch to a subagent**
- ❌ STAR format for briefs targeting an agent → **SDD**
- ❌ Linear (or any external service) mutations without user confirmation, unless explicitly authorized and documented
- ❌ `git push`, `git commit`, `git rebase` silently executed by a skill → **never**
- ❌ `superpowers:*` dependency in the shipped plugin → **dev artifacts only, deleted before push**
- ❌ Adding an npm/bun dep "just for this plugin" → **discuss first**
- ❌ Bypassing pre-commit hook with `--no-verify` → **never**
- ❌ Corporate/neutral plugin names → **the brainrot is the brand**
- ❌ Banner or README in mixed languages → **English everywhere**
- ❌ Any plugin file content (SKILL.md, persona.md, README.md, plugin.json) in any language other than English → **all plugin files are English, always. The voice adapts at runtime via the Language section in persona.md — the file itself is always English.**
- ❌ Redeclaring a plugin's voice in this CLAUDE.md → **the voice lives in `<plugin>/persona.md` exclusively**

## Existing plugins — quick recap

| Plugin | What | Hooks | Skills | Agents | Persona |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `saucy-status` | Saucy/gooning loading messages in statusline | SessionStart, UserPromptSubmit | — | — | `saucy-status/persona.md` |
| `react-monkey` | React implementation specialist with parallel exploration | — | `implement` | `explorer` | `react-monkey/persona.md` |
| `linear-devotee` | Linear issue detection at session start + cascading Project/Milestone/Issue creation, all SDD-formatted | SessionStart, UserPromptSubmit | `greet`, `consummate-project`, `bind-milestone`, `bare-issue` | `seer`, `oracle`, `chronicler`, `acolyte` | `linear-devotee/persona.md` |
| `acid-vision` | Structured spec-writing — Q&A → spec → optional handoff to `linear-devotee` | — | `trip` | — | `acid-vision/persona.md` |

Repo-level: `.claude/hooks/persona-roulette.mjs` picks a random `persona.md` at SessionStart for the current session's default voice (see "Persona Roulette" section above). Local scaffold skills live at `.claude/skills/{scaffold-plugin,scaffold-skill,scaffold-agent}/SKILL.md` with shared `mad-scientist` voice at `.claude/skills/persona.md`.

## Dev workflow recap

1. **Brainstorming** — naming (see Vibe), persona, scope.
2. **SPEC** (optional) — colocate at `<plugin>/SPEC.md` if useful as a reference doc.
3. **PLAN** — `superpowers:writing-plans` is fine as a **dev tool**. Plan lives in `docs/superpowers/plans/` during dev, **deleted before delivery**. No `superpowers:*` dependency must leak into the shipped plugin.
4. **Scaffold** — `/scaffold-plugin`, then `/scaffold-skill`, then `/scaffold-agent` as needed. The skills enforce the conventions by construction.
5. **TDD** for any Node helper or non-trivial logic (`bun test`).
6. **Subagent-driven dev** — dispatch a fresh subagent for each heavy task, keep the main context for coordination only.
7. **Frequent commits**: one commit per logical step (`feat(<plugin>): scaffold...`, etc.). Co-author tag is not required.
8. **Squash-merge** on `main` via GitHub PR (user workflow — no direct merge).
