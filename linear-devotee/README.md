# linear-devotee

Devoted Linear devotee — a Claude Code plugin that detects your Linear issue at the start of a session, sets it `In Progress`, and prepares an SDD-formatted brief so you don't code blind. Plus: a chainable trinity of skills that creates Linear projects, milestones, and issues from spec or vibe.

Voice = feral devotee / carnal worship. The user is the god, the work is the offering.

## Skills

| Skill | What |
|---|---|
| `linear-devotee:greet` | Detects issue from branch or first prompt, sets In Progress, dispatches the `seer` subagent, returns an SDD brief, hands off to plan / clarifications / code / stop |
| `linear-devotee:consummate-project` | Creates a Linear Project from a spec file or vibe-mode Q&A. Drafts a Project-SDD via the `oracle` subagent, previews, mutates Linear on approval, writes a chain-state file, can hand off to `bind-milestone` |
| `linear-devotee:bind-milestone` | Creates a Linear Milestone — chained from `consummate-project` (auto-loads project + drafted phases) or standalone (project picker + freeform hint). Drafts via the `chronicler`, previews, mutates, can hand off to `bare-issue` |
| `linear-devotee:bare-issue` | Creates a Linear Issue with a strict SDD-formatted description — chained from `bind-milestone` (cascades through suggested issues) or standalone (project + optional milestone + hint). Drafts via the `acolyte`, previews, mutates |

## Agents (read-only Linear scouts)

| Agent | Used by | Drafts |
|---|---|---|
| `seer` | `greet` | SDD brief on an existing issue |
| `oracle` | `consummate-project` | Project-SDD + decomposition proposal + suggested issues |
| `chronicler` | `bind-milestone` | Milestone draft (name, scope, target date, suggested issues) |
| `acolyte` | `bare-issue` | SDD-formatted issue draft (Goal/Context/Files/Constraints/Acceptance/Non-goals/Edges) |

All agents are read-only on Linear (no `save_*` tools). Skills do all writes, always behind explicit `(y)` confirmation.

## Detection (`greet` only)

Two stages, **start of session only**:

1. **SessionStart hook** — reads `git branch --show-current`, regex `[A-Z]+-[0-9]+`. Match → invokes `linear-devotee:greet`.
2. **UserPromptSubmit hook** — if the branch didn't yield an ID, scans the first user prompt. Match → invokes `linear-devotee:greet`.

After the first prompt: total silence. The greet window closes.

## Cascade chain

`consummate-project` → `bind-milestone` → `bare-issue` form a hand-off chain. Each skill is also invocable standalone. Chain state lives at `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/data/chain-${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID}.json` and carries the project_id, drafted milestones, drafted issues, and created-vs-pending counters.

## Requirements

- Linear MCP tools (`mcp__claude_ai_Linear__*`) loaded in the session
- A git repository
- For `greet`: a detectable Linear identifier (regex `[A-Z]+-[0-9]+`)

## Install

```
/plugin marketplace add g-bastianelli/franken-agents
/plugin install linear-devotee@franken-agents
