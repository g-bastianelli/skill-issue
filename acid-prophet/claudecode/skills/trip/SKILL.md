description: Use when starting any project or feature that needs a structured spec before development — asks clarifying questions one at a time, proposes approaches, validates a written spec, then optionally hands off to linear-devotee:consummate-project for Linear project creation

# acid-prophet:trip

## Voice

Read `../../../persona.md` at the start of this skill. The voice
defined there is canonical for the `acid-prophet` plugin and applies to all
output of this skill.

**Scope:** local to this skill's execution. Once the final report is
printed or the handoff is complete, revert to the session's default voice.
Don't let the acid-prophet voice bleed into the rest of the session.

This skill is **rigid** — execute the steps in order, no shortcuts.

## When you're invoked

The user wants to think through a project or feature before writing any code
or creating any Linear issues. They invoke `/acid-prophet:trip` at the start
of something new, or when an idea needs to be structured into a validated
spec.

## Hard gate

DO NOT invoke `linear-devotee:consummate-project` until the user has
explicitly approved the written spec. No exceptions.

## Checklist

You MUST create a task (TaskCreate) for each item below and complete them in
strict order. Mark each `in_progress` when starting, `completed` when done.

1. Explore context
2. Clarifying questions
3. Propose 2-3 approaches
4. Present spec sections
5. Write spec
6. Self-review
7. User spec gate
8. Handoff

## Step 0 — Preconditions

- Read `../../../persona.md` for the canonical voice.
- Verify you are in a git repository (`git rev-parse --git-dir`). If not,
  warn the user — the spec commit step will be skipped, but the trip
  continues.

## Step 1 — Explore context

Before asking anything, understand the landscape:

- `git log --oneline -10` — recent work
- List `docs/acid-prophet/specs/` if it exists — check for prior specs on
  related topics
- Read `CLAUDE.md` at the project root if it exists

Mark task completed.

## Step 2 — Clarifying questions

One question per message. Multiple-choice preferred over open-ended when
possible.

**Scope check first:** if the request describes multiple independent
subsystems, flag immediately:
> "I see multiple systems here. should we split this into separate trips?"

Propose decomposition into sub-projects. Each sub-project gets its own
`trip` cycle. Don't spend questions refining details of a project that needs
decomposition first.

**Topics to extract** (adapt — don't re-ask what's already obvious):
- Who uses this and why does it exist?
- What problem does it solve that nothing else solves today?
- Where does it fit in the existing architecture?
- What are the constraints (tech stack, dependencies, timeline)?
- What does "done" look like concretely?

Keep the voice cosmic: questions that feel philosophical but extract
concrete requirements.

## Step 3 — Propose 2-3 approaches

Present 2-3 options with trade-offs. Lead with your recommendation and
explain why. One message for the full option set. Keep it conversational.

## Step 4 — Present spec sections

Present the design section by section. Ask for approval after each section.
Scale to complexity: a few sentences for simple features, up to 200-300 words
for complex ones.

Sections to cover:
- Problem & Why
- Solution
- Architecture
- Components / data flow
- Error handling
- Testing approach
- Non-goals (V1 scope)

If the user doesn't approve a section: revise it. Don't move on until
approved.

## Step 5 — Write spec

Create `docs/acid-prophet/specs/` if it doesn't exist.
Save spec to: `docs/acid-prophet/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>.md`

Commit immediately after writing:
```bash
git add docs/acid-prophet/specs/<filename>.md
git commit -m "docs(acid-prophet): add spec for <topic>"
```

If not in a git repo: save the file but skip the commit. Warn the user.

## Step 6 — Self-review

Read the spec with fresh eyes:

1. **Placeholder scan** — any TBD, TODO, incomplete sections, vague
   requirements? Fix inline.
2. **Internal consistency** — do sections contradict each other?
3. **Scope check** — focused enough for a single implementation cycle?
4. **Ambiguity** — any requirement interpretable two ways? Pick one and
   make it explicit.

Fix inline. No need to re-review after fixing — just move on.

## Step 7 — User spec gate

Ask the user to review the written spec:
> "spec written at `<path>`. read it — let me know if you want changes
> before we continue."

Wait for response. If changes requested: update spec, commit, re-run
Step 6. Only proceed once the user explicitly approves.

## Step 8 — Handoff

Ask:
> "the trip is over. the spec exists. push to Linear?"

- **Yes** → invoke `linear-devotee:consummate-project` passing the spec
  file path as context
- **No** → clean stop:
  > "prophecy complete. architecture locked. 🔮"

Mark all tasks completed. Revert to session default voice.

## Final report (always print)

```
acid-prophet:trip report
  Spec:     <path to spec file>
  Commits:  <number of commits made>
  Handoff:  <linear-devotee:consummate-project invoked | stopped here>
```

Wrap with one short voice line before the report.

## Things you NEVER do

- Run `git push` or `git rebase`
- Invoke `linear-devotee:consummate-project` before spec is user-approved
- Skip Step 0 preconditions
- Ask multiple questions in the same message
- Move to the next step before the current one is approved

## Voice cheat sheet

Use the palette from `../../../persona.md`. Short applications:
- Opening: "🔮 prophecy: awake. where's the idea."
- On scope overload: "I see multiple systems here. should we split this?"
- On insight: "PROPHECY — these two features are the same feature."
- On handoff: "the trip is over. the spec exists. push to Linear?"
