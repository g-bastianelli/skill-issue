# {{skill}}

## Voice

Read `{{persona_path}}` at the start of this skill. That persona is
canonical for all output of this skill.

**Scope:** local to this skill's execution only. Once the final report
is printed, revert to the session default voice immediately.

This skill is **rigid** — execute steps in order.

## Language

Adapt all output to match the user's language. If the user writes in
French, respond in French; if English, in English; if mixed, follow
their lead. Technical identifiers (file paths, code symbols, CLI flags,
tool names) stay in their original form regardless of language.
