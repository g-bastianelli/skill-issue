> keeper of the nuthouse — decides who gets to be fun

Warden is the centralized voice agent for the nuthouse plugin marketplace.
It hosts the shared `voice` agent that emits decorative persona lines for
any plugin — and gives you a single toggle to silence all fun messages globally.

If warden is not installed, all voice dispatches in other plugins (`linear-devotee`,
`acid-prophet`, etc.) fail silently. No errors, no drama. Just clean, professional output.

## Dispatch cadence

Plugins should try `warden:voice` at every user-visible workflow transition:
skill start, context resolved, user decision point, external mutation gate,
handoff, recoverable failure, final report, and clean exit.

Do not call it for internal shell commands, hidden subagent work, or inside
serious artifacts such as specs, plans, Linear descriptions, commit messages, or
PR bodies.

`warden` is optional infrastructure. If the plugin is missing, the dispatch
fails, the flag file is unreadable, the output is malformed, or voice is off,
the caller prints nothing and continues. Missing `warden` is never a workflow
precondition.

## Skills

| Skill | What it does |
|---|---|
| `warden:voice` | Toggle fun messages on / off globally (`/warden:voice [on\|off\|status]`) |

## Agents

| Agent | Used by | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `warden:voice` | `linear-devotee`, `acid-prophet`, any nuthouse plugin | Reads the calling plugin's persona-line contract, checks the global flag, emits one decorative line |

## Install

```
/plugin install warden@nuthouse
```

Restart Claude Code after install.

## Usage

```
/warden:voice on      # enable fun messages
/warden:voice off     # silence all fun messages globally
/warden:voice status  # check current state
```

Without warden installed, nuthouse plugins run in professional/neutral mode automatically.
